# Image Color Changer - Rust

Welcome to the Image Color Changer project written in Rust! This application allows you to change the colors of an image, providing a simple yet powerful tool for color manipulation.

## Overview

Image Color Changer is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to modify the colors of an image. Whether you want to apply a global color shift, convert to grayscale, or perform more advanced color transformations, this tool has you covered.

## Features

- **Color Shifting:** Change the overall color tone of the image.
- **Grayscale Conversion:** Convert the image to grayscale for a classic look.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters to fine-tune the color transformation.
- **Efficient Processing:** Built with Rust for performance and speed.
